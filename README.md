RSA-Factoring-Challenge
RSA (Rivest Shamir Adleman) is a public-key cryptosystem that is widely used for secure data transmission. It is also one of the oldest.
RSA Laboratories states that: for each RSA number n, there exists prime numbers p and q such that

n = p Ã— q.
The problem is to find these two primes, given only n.
